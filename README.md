## BIT Onboarding

The BIT onboarding process familiarizes new personal with the BIT team, gives an overview of lab/Penn systems, and grants access to our systems.

If you have PennKey access you can follow the instructions for accessing the internal BIT wiki to view [the BIT Onboarding process](https://github.com/upenn/BIT/wiki/BIT-Onboarding).

If you do not yet have access your supervisor can address the process with you.

## Internal BIT Wiki

Our internal wiki is located here: https://github.com/upenn/BIT/wiki
