# Penn Neurocognitive Battery (CNB)

The CNB is a computerized neurocognitive test battery developed by Dr. Ruben C. Gur and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania. The web-based Penn CNB is made available to administer online [https://webcnp.med.upenn.edu/]. The CNB is comprised of a series of tests that have been applied in neuroimaging studies and can be used either in a scanner as part of a functional neuroimaging study or outside a scanner for measuring individual differences in performance. Tests measure accuracy and speed of performance in major domains of cognition, including executive-control functions (abstraction, attention, working memory), episodic memory (verbal, facial, spatial), complex cognitive processing (language reasoning, nonverbal reasoning, spatial processing), social cognition (emotion identification, emotion intensity differentiation, age differentiation) and sensorimotor and motor speed. The CNB has been translated to over 25 languages and can be customized based on the age of the participant (child or adult), available test-taking time and the testing environment.

## Tests Adminsistered in the CNB

1. Motor Praxis Test (MPRAXIS, MPRACT)
   The mpraxis is a measure of sensorimotor ability. This test requires moving the mouse and clicking on a green square that disappears after the click. The        square gets smaller and appears in unpredictable locations (Gur et al., 2001, 2010)
