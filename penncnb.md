# Penn Neurocognitive Battery (CNB)

The CNB is a computerized neurocognitive test battery developed by Dr. Ruben C. Gur and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania. The web-based Penn CNB is made available to administer online [https://webcnp.med.upenn.edu/]. The CNB is comprised of a series of tests that have been applied in neuroimaging studies and can be used either in a scanner as part of a functional neuroimaging study or outside a scanner for measuring individual differences in performance. Tests measure accuracy and speed of performance in major domains of cognition, including executive-control functions (abstraction, attention, working memory), episodic memory (verbal, facial, spatial), complex cognitive processing (language reasoning, nonverbal reasoning, spatial processing), social cognition (emotion identification, emotion intensity differentiation, age differentiation) and sensorimotor and motor speed. The CNB has been translated to over 25 languages and can be customized based on the age of the participant (child or adult), available test-taking time and the testing environment.

## Tests Adminsistered in the CNB by Domain

### Executive-Control Domain

1. Abstraction, Inhibition and Working Memory Test (AIM)
2. Penn Conditional Exclusion Test (PCET)
3. Penn Continuous Performance Test (PCPT)
   The Penn Continuous Performance Test (PCPT; Kurtz et al., 2001) uses a standard CPT paradigm. The participant responds to a set of 7-segment displays            presented 1/sec., whenever they form a digit (NUMBERS, initial 3 min) or letter (LETTERS, next 3 min). The number of true positive responses is recorded as      the accuracy score and the median response time for true positive responses is the measure of attention speed.
4. Letter/Fractal N-back (LNB/FNB)
5. Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)
6. Go-No-Go Test (GNG)


### Episodic Memory Domain

1. Penn Word Memory Test (PWMT)
   The Penn Word Memory Test (PWMT; Gur et al., 1997) presents 20 target words that are then mixed with 20 distractors equated for frequency, length,                concreteness and low imageability. The participant’s score reflects the number of correctly recognized targets and correctly rejected foils. Median response      times for correct responses serves as a measure of speed. A 20 min delayed recall procedure is also administered.
2. Penn Face Memory Test (PFMT)
   The Penn Face Memory Test (PFMT; Gur et al., 1997) presents 20 digitized faces that are then mixed with 20 distractors equated for age, gender and ethnicity.    The participant’s score reflects the number of correctly recognized targets and correctly rejected foils, and median response times for correct responses        serves as a measure of speed. The procedure is repeated at 20 min delay. 
3. Visual Object Learning Test (VOLT)
   The Visual Object Learning Test (VOLT; Glahn et al., 1997) uses Euclidean shapes as stimuli with the same paradigm as the word and face. The participant’s        score reflects the number of correctly recognized targets and correctly rejected foils, and again median response times for correct responses serves as a        measure of speed. The procedure is repeated at 20 min delay. 

### Sensorimotor Processing Speed 

1. Motor Praxis Test (MPRACT)
   The Mouse Practice task (MP; Gur et al., 2001a) requires moving the mouse and clicking as quickly as possible on a green square that disappears after the        click. The square gets increasingly small. Since it is rare for participants to miss a target, no accuracy score is calculated and the median response time is    used as the main dependent measure.
